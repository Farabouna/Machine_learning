## 🚧 Project
Walmart's marketing team has requested the development of a machine learning model capable of predicting weekly sales with high precision. This model will:

✅ Help Walmart understand how economic factors influence sales.  
✅ Assist in forecasting demand to optimize inventory and staffing.  
✅ Support strategic planning for future marketing campaigns.

## 🎯 Goals
The project is divided into the following steps:  

🔹 Part 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Data Preprocessing  
🔹 Part 2: Train a Linear Regression Model as a baseline  
🔹 Part 3: Avoid overfitting with a Regularized Regression Model  
🔹 Part 4: Fine-tune the regularization strength  
🔹 Part 5: Introduce weights to improve prediction accuracy
