## 📝 Projects Overview
1. Supervised Machine Learning Projects:

- Walmart Project:
A supervised machine learning project aimed at predicting weekly sales with the best precision possible. Such a model would help them understand better how the sales are influenced by economic indicators, and might be used to plan future marketing campaigns.

- Conversion Rate Project:
This project involves predicting and optimizing the conversion rate of a famous newsletter created by independent data scientists (www.datascienceweekly.org). It focuses on building a predictive model that helps businesses understand user behavior and improve their conversion rates through targeted strategies.

2. Unsupervised Machine Learning Project:

- Uber Pickups Project:
An unsupervised machine learning project that analyzes Uber pickup data. The goal of this project is to segment pickup locations and times, providing insights into user behavior patterns and optimizing the service's operations.
