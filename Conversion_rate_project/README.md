# 📊 Data Science Weekly: Predict Conversion Rate
## 📇 Company's Description
Data Science Weekly is a well-known newsletter created by independent data scientists. The platform allows users to register their email addresses and receive weekly updates on data science trends and applications.

---

## 🚧 Project Overview
The Data Science Weekly team aims to gain deeper insights into user behavior on their website. Specifically, they want to determine whether it's possible to predict if a user will subscribe to the newsletter based on a few key features.

---

## 🔍 Key Objectives:
- Build a machine learning model to predict user conversions (i.e., subscriptions).  
- Analyze the most important features influencing user behavior.  
- Improve the f1-score, which is used to rank models in the competition.  

To achieve this, a dataset containing website traffic data has been open-sourced, enabling data scientists to develop and compare predictive models.

## 🎯 Project Goals
The project consists of four main phases:  
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 🔎  
- Analyze data distribution, correlations, and missing values.  
- Preprocess the data to prepare it for machine learning models.  

2. Baseline Model: Logistic Regression 📉  
- Train a simple logistic regression model as a starting point.  
- Evaluate its performance using the f1-score.  

3. Model Improvement 🚀  
- Experiment with feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and advanced models.  
- Optimize the model to improve its predictive performance.  

4. Feature Importance Analysis 🔬  
- Interpret the best-performing model’s parameters.  
- Identify key factors that influence user conversions.

## 📊 Evaluation Metric  
The model performance is evaluated using the f1-score, which balances precision and recall to ensure an optimal trade-off between false positives and false negatives.
