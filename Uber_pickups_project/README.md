## 🚧 Project: Reducing Wait Times  
One of Uber's main challenges is ensuring that drivers are available when and where users need them. For example:

A user might be in San Francisco’s Financial District, while Uber drivers are waiting for customers in Castro.

Even though these neighborhoods are relatively close, users may still have to wait 10 to 15 minutes for a pickup, which is too long.

Uber's research indicates that users are only willing to wait 5-7 minutes before canceling their ride.

To solve this problem, Uber’s data team is working on a project to predict high-demand zones in major cities and recommend "hot zones" for drivers at any given time of the day.

🎯 Goals
The objective is to create algorithms that identify hot-zones for Uber drivers and visualize results on a dashboard.

Project Breakdown:
✅ Part 1: Data Preparation and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
✅ Part 2: Clustering with K-Means and DBScan for one day of the week and one hour of the day
✅ Part 3: Extending clustering analysis to all days of the week
✅ Part 4: Making recommendations for Uber drivers based on the findings
